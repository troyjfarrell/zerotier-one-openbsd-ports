ZeroTier is a software-defined virtual networking layer.  It can be used for
on-premise network virtualization, as a peer to peer VPN for mobile teams, for
hybrid or multi-data-center cloud deployments, or just about anywhere else
secure software defined virtual networking is useful.

ZeroTier-One is the OS-level client service, which can join ZeroTier virtual
networks and serve as a network controller.
